# FixAnimalCount

Fixes a glitch on the auto-slaughter total animals column.

In vanilla auto-slaughter based on total number is only perfomed using allowed slaughterable animals

Example:
- total limit = 8
- males = 5
- pregnant females = 3
- non-pregnant females = 2
- slaughter pregnant = OFF

total (as displayed in GUI) = male + pregnant females + non-pregnant females = **10**

even if 10 > 8, no slaughter occurs because internally the "real" calculation considers only 5 males + 2 non-pregnant females = total **7**

this mod fixes the value of the total count, considering pregnant females only if the specifich check is toggled: it aligns the logic to how bonded animal are managed. Indeed if "slaughter bonded" is NOT check, they are NOT counted in total column.

Note: this mod is now included in [XNDTinyTweaks >= 1.4.2](https://github.com/emipa606/XNDTinyTweaks/releases/latest)

**No longer needed since Rimworld 1.5 because the issue has been fixed in vanilla.**
